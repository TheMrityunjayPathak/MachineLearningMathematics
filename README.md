## Introduction 

- Math is the core concept in machine learning which is used to express the idea within the machine learning model.

- Mathematics forms the backbone of Machine Learning, So Understanding the Mathematical concepts is not just an advantage but an absolute necessity.

- These are some core mathematical concepts that power Machine Learning :

   - üî¢ Linear Algebra : Matrices, vectors, and their transformations are fundamental to understanding how data is represented and manipulated in ML models.

   - üìà Calculus : Understanding derivatives and integrals helps in optimizing models through techniques like gradient descent.

   - üìä Statistics and Probability : These form the bedrock of making inferences from data, understanding distributions, and estimating probabilities in ML algorithms.
